Core Concepts- Internal workings- Advanced patterns- Common pitfalls- Best practices 2. Performance & Optimization- Performance bottlenecks- Optimization techniques- Memory management -Resource utilization 3. Integration & Architecture- Integration patterns- Architectural decisions- Scalability considerations- Error handling 4. Debugging & Troubleshooting - Common issues - Edge cases - Error patterns - Problem diagnosis Format Requirements: - Generate exactly 10 questions- Each question must have 4 options- Don't provide or indicate correct answers- Include relevant code snippets or diagrams- Each question should take 60-90 seconds to solve Style Guidelines:- Use clear, professional language - Focus on practical, real-world scenarios- Make all options educational- Provide context when necessary ";
